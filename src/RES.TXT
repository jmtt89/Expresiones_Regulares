JAVA
Java is a programming language originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, and object-oriented, and is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere". Java is considered by many as one of the most influential programming languages of the 20th century, and is widely used from application software to web applications.
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were developed by Sun from 1995. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of their Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java and GNU Classpath.

Perl
Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.[1][2] Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions and become widely popular amongst programmers. Larry Wall continues to oversee development of the core language, and its upcoming version, Perl 6.
Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed.[3] The language provides powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data length limits of many contemporary Unix tools,[4] facilitating easy manipulation of text files. It is also used for graphics programming, system administration, network programming, applications that require database access and CGI programming on the Web. Perl is nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of programming languages" due to its flexibility and adaptability.

python
Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language [2] whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability.[3] Python aims to combine "remarkable power with very clear syntax",[4] and its standard library is large and comprehensive. Its use of indentation for block delimiters is unusual among popular programming languages.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms , primarily but not limited to object oriented, imperative and, to a lesser extent, functional programming. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts.
The reference implementation of Python ( CPython ) is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do all or nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.

base
In chemistry, a base is most commonly thought of as an aqueous substance that can accept hydroxide ions. Bases are also the oxides or hydroxides of metals. A soluble base is also often referred to as an alkali if hydroxide ions (OH-) are involved. This refers to the Brønsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases. Alternative definitions of bases include electron pair donors (Lewis), and as sources of hydroxide anions (Arrhenius). In addition to this, bases can commonly be thought of as any chemical compound that, when dissolved in water, gives a solution with a hydroxide ion activity lower than that of pure water, i.e. a pH higher than 7.0 at standard conditions. Examples of simple bases are sodium hydroxide and ammonia.
Bases can be thought of as the chemical opposite of acids. A reaction between an acid and base is called neutralization. Bases and acids are seen as opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium ion (H3O+) concentration in water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. Bases react with acids to produce water and salts (or their solutions).

MASS EFFECT 2
Mass Effect 2 is an action role-playing game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. The game is a sequel to Mass Effect, and the second game of the series. The game was released on PC and Xbox 360 in North America, Europe and India on January 26, 2010, Australia on January 28, and New Zealand on January 29.
After the events of the original game, Commander Shepard is killed in an ambush by a mysterious alien species called the Collectors. Shepard is revived two years after the attack by an enigmatic organization called Cerberus, and is tasked with finding out more about the Collectors and why they are abducting entire human colonies. Many elements and locations from Mass Effect return, in addition to ones new to the series.
A critical and commercial success, Mass Effect 2 had shipped over two million copies worldwide within a week of release[11], and has also received highly favorable reviews[12]. It is ranked third on the Xbox 360 according to GameRankings, and is, overall, the fourteenth best reviewed game of all time[13]. The game holds several perfect scores and has an average of 94 and 96 for the PC and Xbox 360 on Metacritic respectively [14][15].
